In this project, I have customized WooCommerce by enhancing category and product detail pages with custom subtitles, buttons for manuals, data sheets, feature lists, and a static image. Filters, secondary descriptions, and a structured layout were added to archives. Single-product pages were streamlined by removing sidebars.
